Who are the top performers? (Top 5 consultants, Total Sales by Sales Team)

Which channels and training levels drive results? (Advertising Channel, Training Levels Fees, Training Models Fees)

How is performance trending over time? (Total Earnings by Month, Enrolled Courses over time)

🚀 Getting started

Open Sales_Performance_Dashboard.xlsx in Excel.

If prompted, Enable Editing and Enable Content (for slicers/refresh).

Use the Slicers on the left to filter by Month and Sales team.

Hover any chart to see precise values; right-click a PivotChart to Show Details.

🔄 Refreshing the data

If you’ve connected the pivots to your own data source:

Replace or update the underlying table/query.

Go to Data → Refresh All to rebuild all pivots and KPIs.

If you added new fields, open a PivotTable and drag fields as needed.

Tip: Keep source data in a single Excel Table (Ctrl/Cmd + T) with clear column names. This ensures pivots expand automatically when new rows are added.

🔧 Customization tips

Colors & theme: Page Layout → Colors/Fonts to match your brand.

KPIs: Edit the formula cards (e.g., VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP cells) to show new metrics.

Charts: Right-click any PivotChart → Change Chart Type.

Slicers: Insert more slicers (Insert → Slicer) for regions, products, etc.

New visuals: Duplicate a KPI card or chart, then point it to a different Pivot.
